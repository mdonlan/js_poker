todo:

-only show correct player bet buttons
  -don't show check if there is a bet set this round

-animate the player bet buttons

-remove all hiding of player bet buttons and just disable them to prevent random clicks when not players turn
  -since the ai turns all go fast it wil almost always be the players turn, no need to hide the buttons
